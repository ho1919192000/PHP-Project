# PHP-Project
Connecting to and interacting with a database is such an important part of any web application which needs to store and retrieve data in a manageable way. PHP makes such interactions relatively easy in order to expand our project functionality.

## Database Setup:
Using PHPMyAdmin, create a new database called "myimages".
Create a table named "imagedata" with 3 columns.
Column 1: "id: int - PRIMARY INDEX, AUTO INCREMENT
Column 2: "path: varchar - 255
Column 3: "title: varchar - 255
Simply use the root user authentication

## Project Functionality:
You will extend the project from last week with this new functionality.
Add the ability to define an image title when uploading images.
Save the title and file name to the database.
Change the view functionality to read from the database and additionally display image titles.
Add the ability to DELETE both image files and associated database entries from the view page.
